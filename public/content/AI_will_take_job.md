AI loves routine. If your job is repetitive and predictable, it’s in the AI crosshairs. Here’s where automation is already making waves:
- **Manufacturing**: Robots are the new assembly line heroes—faster, stronger, and never needing a coffee break.
- **Customer Service**: Chatbots are handling FAQs and basic support 24/7, freeing up humans for trickier problems.
- **Data Entry**: AI crunches numbers and processes forms at lightning speed, making manual data work a thing of the past.

### 🌱 New Careers Born from AI

But it’s not all doom and gloom! AI is also a job creator:
- **AI Engineers & Developers**: Someone has to build and maintain these smart systems.
- **Data Scientists**: The more data, the more demand for people who can make sense of it.
- **AI Ethics & Compliance**: As AI grows, so does the need for watchdogs to keep it fair and ethical.

### 🤝 Humans + AI: The Ultimate Team

AI isn’t just about replacement—it’s about *augmentation*. Think of AI as your digital sidekick:
- **Healthcare**: AI spots patterns in scans, but doctors make the final call.
