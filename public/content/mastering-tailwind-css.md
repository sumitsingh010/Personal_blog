## ðŸš€ Introduction: Tailwind CSS in 2025

Tailwind CSS is still the go-to utility-first framework for developers who want to build stunning, responsive websitesâ€”fast.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Tailwind CSS Is a Must-Have in 2025

### Utility-First, Supercharged

Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach is now the industry standard. Every class does one thingâ€”and does it well. With the latest updates, you get even more granular control, smarter autocomplete, and AI-powered suggestions right in your editor.

### Effortless Customization

The `tailwind.config.js` file is your design playground. In 2025, itâ€™s easier than ever to extend themes, add custom utilities, and even integrate with design tokens from Figma or other tools. Keep your brand consistent and your workflow seamless.

## ðŸ“± Responsive & Adaptive by Default

Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities now support foldables, wearables, and ultra-wide screens. Use intuitive breakpoints to create layouts that look great everywhere:

```html
<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row xl:flex-row-3">
  <div class="w-full md:w-1/2 p-4">Column 1</div>
  <div class="w-full md:w-1/2 p-4">Column 2</div>
  <div class="hidden xl:block xl:w-1/3 p-4">Column 3 (XL only)</div>
</div>
```

---

## ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode & Beyond

Dark mode is just the beginning. Tailwind now supports system themes, custom color schemes, and prefers-contrast for accessibilityâ€”all with simple classes.

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-black dark:text-white">
  Welcome to the future!
</div>
```
